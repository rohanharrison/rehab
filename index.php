	<p>
	Welcome to University of Hartford Prosthetic Training Across Borders.
	Education materials were created at the University of Hartford related to lower extremity prosthetic use, tailored specifically for rehabilitation of persons with above-knee amputations in developing nations. The purpose of these materials is to educate clinicians and patients about proper limb care and prosthetic use. Digital copies of these education materials- which include clinic posters, a clinician training manual, and a patient take-home pamphlet- are now available to access for free. Coming soon: DVD or access to a video library demonstrating some of the written manual content.
