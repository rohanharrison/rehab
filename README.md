# Description
The University of Hartford's Department of Rehabilitation Sciences requested a primarily mobile website which could be accessed from low bandwidth Internet services in third world countries. The website includes all of the necessarily information requested by the group, including posters that they had created themselves.

# Technology
The website is accomplished using Bootstrap and jQuery for dynamic scaling for desktop and mobile. The website also uses PHP to create a templating system for common header and body files which may be cached for a smaller bandwidth footprint.
